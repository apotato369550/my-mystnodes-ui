I want to create a CLI tool + console UI based-tool + (soon-to-be) web UI tool to track the status of all my Mysterium Nodes
It will work similar to my homelab manager, but will be specialized for Myst Node management, for both bare-metal and docker installations.

It should function similarly to my other project, homelab-manager, with the ability to add and onboard nodes, but instead of SSH, it'll be through their API key.

Use @TEQUILA_API_DOCS.md as a reference when building this service. It'll mainly be a bash script
